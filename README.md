This project implements the following services:
    
* local user registration/authentication.
* authentication with Google+, Facebook, and OpenID Connect providers.
* lobby services (to create/list/join/automatch multi-player online games).
* real-time presence and communications.
* notifications (... well, this is not yet implemented).

They are provided using the [WebSocket Application Messaging Protocol](http://wamp.ws) (WAMP v2) specification.
