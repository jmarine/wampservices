Web Game Services
=================

Version: 2.0-alpha1


About
-----

This project implements the following services:
    
* local user registration/authentication.
* authentication with Google+, Facebook, and OpenID Connect providers.
* lobby services (to create/list/join/automatch multi-player online games).
* real-time presence and communications.
* notifications (... well, this is not yet implemented).

The server-side is developed in Java language, but there are also Javascript libraries for browser applications.
The services are provided over websockets with the [WAMP v2](http://wamp.ws) specification.
